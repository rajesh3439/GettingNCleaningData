The data is processed in accordance with the tidydata principles 

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The measurement variables are given below. The original measurement's mean and standard deviation (std) variables are averaged per subject per activity and presented as final data.
.avg - indicates the average of the variable.
